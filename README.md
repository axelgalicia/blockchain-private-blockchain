# Private Blockchain

This is an example of how to create a very basic private blockchain using Javascript and LevelDB to keep the blocks stored in the disk.

## Installation

1) Install Node.js
2) Install dependencies
  ```
  npm install
  ```
## How to use

3) Run the main file calles simpleChain.js by running the command below:

```
node simpleChain.js
```

You will see the output in the console for the blocks that are created, by default there are 10 blocks being created.

The chain is being validated and then erros are introduced and validated again showing the errors.
